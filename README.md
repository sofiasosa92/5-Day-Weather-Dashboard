Challenge 6- 5 day weather forecast dashboard
For challenge 6, I was given teh task to create a 5 day weather application that displays the user city search current weather and the next 5 days. I used the 5 Day 3 hour weather API from https://openweathermap.org/forecast5. I also used HTLM, JavaScript and CSS.
